    <!-- Cycling test: FTP information -->
    <string name="cycling_test_ftp_info">The functional threshold power (FTP) value reflects the intensity that a well-trained cyclist can maintain for an hour.\n\nUpdate your FTP value to get your power zones up to date, which will help you train at the right intensity.

    <!-- Cycling test info pop-up 2 -->
    <string name="cycling_test_info2">For the most reliable results, make sure you stay on the same power level throughout the test. Slowing down will make the results less reliable.\n\nIn the first test, we\&apos;ll guide you with a power target that\&apos;s based on your background information. This helps you maintain a steady power throughout the test. When you repeat the test, the target is based on your earlier results.</string>

    <!-- Cycling test info pop-up 3 -->
    <string name="cycling_test_info3">Use the test to keep track of your cycling performance and to define your individual power zones. Your FTP result divided by your weight allows you to compare with other cyclists of the same sex as you. Remember to update your weight in your settings.</string>
